# Extended-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
National University of Singapore Mechanical Engineering Final Year Project

The Extended Physics Informed Neural Network (xPINN) is an extension to the original Physics Informed Neural Network. In this project, the xPINN was subjected to various use cases to strike a comparison between the xPINN and the PINN.
