# Extended-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks
National University of Singapore Mechanical Engineering Final Year Project

The Extended Physics Informed Neural Network (xPINN) is an extension to the original Physics Informed Neural Network. In this project, the xPINN was subjected to various use cases to strike a comparison between the xPINN and the PINN.

This project uses code from [Rao's Repository](https://github.com/Raocp/PINN-laminar-flow) as an experimental baseline while making modifications for the xPINN.

The [Physics Informed Neural Network](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs) and [Extended Physics Informed Neural Network](https://github.com/AmeyaJagtap/XPINNs) were inspired by Raissi et al. and Jagtap et al., where they conducted initial research into these novel frameworks for flow predictions.
